            The Airplane Seating chart was one of the first projects I ever did. It was done in C, which is also the first
            language I learned, and it took me roughly a week to complete. How it worked was that you had to enter some basic
            personal information about yourself, then choose the seat you'd like, after you chose your seat it would be taken in
            the chart and if you had to cancel you could just re-enter your personal information and cancel whichever seats you chose.

            The Crossword game is a python based program that I made for one of my final projects for my python course last
            year. The user is givin clues as to what the mystery word is and can select which word they want try and solve.
            Once they guess the correct word, it will fill out in the crossword. Once you complete the entire crossword you will
            recieve a congratulatory message and the program will tell you how many attempts it took for you to complete it.
